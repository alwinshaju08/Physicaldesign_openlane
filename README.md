  <summary>Introduction</summary>
With the introduction of open-source technology for chip creation, many RTL designs and EDA Tools were made available for free. The [SKY130 PDK] fills the gap in a whole Open source chip development.(https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules.html) from Skywater Technologies and Google. There were a number of EDA Tools with distinct functions throughout the design cycle. The design flow was not clear, and the Skywater pdk was only compatible with industrial equipment.  These problems were addressed by [OpenLane](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane), which offered a fully automated and tidy RTL to GDSII flow. OpenLane is not a product; rather, it is a flow made up of a number of EDA tools, automation scripts, and Skywater-pdks that have been optimized for use with open-source EDA tools.
